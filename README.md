Indian Classical Dance Analysis

Problem:
Indian classical dance forms, known for their rich tradition and intricate movements, have long been underrepresented in digital analysis. Despite their cultural importance, there are limited resources that capture the nuances of these dances, including posture, rhythm, and gestures. For new practitioners, researchers, and technology enthusiasts, there is a lack of accessible tools to analyze dance movements in terms of technicalities such as rhythm patterns, mudras, and expression.

Solution:
This repository seeks to fill this gap by providing a structured framework for analyzing various Indian classical dance forms. The project uses modern machine learning techniques to process dance videos, identify key movements, analyze rhythm, and classify dance sequences. The goal is to assist dancers in understanding their performances, enable researchers to study traditional dance movements in detail, and create a bridge between classical dance and cutting-edge technologies like computer vision and artificial intelligence.

Through a combination of video processing and pose estimation algorithms, the system extracts detailed information about the dancerâ€™s movements, posture, and expression. The resulting dataset is valuable for both academic research and practical applications in performance analysis.

Tech Stack:

Python

OpenCV

TensorFlow / PyTorch (for Machine Learning)

MediaPipe (for pose detection)

Pandas and NumPy (for data processing)

Matplotlib (for data visualization)

Impact:
This project helps dancers and scholars easily track and refine their technique, making it accessible to both novices and experts. It also contributes to the digitization of traditional Indian arts, opening up new possibilities for research and cross-disciplinary exploration between technology and culture. With the potential to create interactive learning tools, this project aims to bring Indian classical dance into the digital age, making it more accessible to the global community.

This repository is an ongoing effort, with plans to extend its functionalities to include more advanced features like gesture recognition and emotion analysis in dance.
